            <h2>About Me</h2>

I have completed multiple certifications in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity fundamentals from IBM, demonstrating my eagerness to learn and expand my skill set in the dynamic field of IT.

                I have gained hands-on experience in web development as an intern at GoMedicos, where I developed an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, MongoDB, and MySQL. I have also completed a frontend development internship from IBM Skill Build, where I enhanced my proficiency in HTML and CSS. In addition, I have showcased my problem-solving and programming skills in various academic projects using C, C++, Java, and data structures. I have maintained a high GPA of above 8.0 throughout the BCA program and received recognition for excellence in web development.
                
                I am passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly solutions that can make a positive impact on the society and the environment.
